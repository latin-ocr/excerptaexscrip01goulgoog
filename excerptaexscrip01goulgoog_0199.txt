Poenius Ovrnrus Niso, u celebrated Roman poet, wos bom ut
Sulmo, e town of the Peligni, about fo years before the christian
eru. His parents were of equestrian ruisti, ond edueated their son for
tho bur, but he soon forsook this ond every other pursuit for the
cultivation ef poetry, und et length beoonm one of the most udmired
und eminent poete in the oourt of Angustus. His prosperit wer,
however, of short continuunce. Hoving incurred, by some own
offenoe, the dis leusure of tlte emperor, he wes bonished to Tomos, e
town near the iuriae seu; where, siler mnny ineffectunl ottempts to
obtain the pordon of Augustus, he ended his da s, in the ε’ hth year
of hie bumshment, ond the fifty-ninth year of ' age. ‘iie poetry
of Ovid hos long been celebrated for ite variety, eweetness, und
elegunoe. But the frequent violations of modesty, whiob disgreoe
some purte of his writings, detraet much from the meritos this gifted
poet. Hb Metamorphoses, though not theumost finished of his ppems,

among the nncrents, und heppily oonneoted them with eeoh other.
Many of these traditione eppenr to hovebeen originally founded on
historioul faots; but it is, in most instnnoes, impossible to osee tho
truths of lrietory through the tries of superstition end the fictione of
