Cassa. Julius thsar was one of the most celebrated of the Ro-

subsequent εωὲἶέοη. Endowed with extraordinary talenta, and influ-
enced by boun ss ambition, he made himself master of the liberties
of his country, and assumed at length the imperial power. His reign
was, however, of short continuanoe. A conspiracy was formed against
him, with Brutus and Cassius at its head, and he was assassinated in
the senatehouse, on the Ides of March, forty-four years before tho
Christian era. Soon alter his death, a new star, or rather comet, was
