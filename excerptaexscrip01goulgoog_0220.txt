, Clonus wasthe son of Agenor, king of Phoenicia. Jupiter, having

transformed himself intoabull, prevailed on Europa, the sister of this “ l

prince, to get on his back, and immediately plunging into the sea, he
carried her across it into Crete. Agenor, ignorant of the fate of his
daughter, and discousolate at her loss, ordered Cadmus to go' in search
of Europa; with a command not to return to Phoenicia till he had
found her. The pursuitof Cadmus was fruitless. He could hear no
tidings of his sister, andnot daring to return to his native land with-
out her, he resolved to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, that he
mi lrt know in what part of the earth to fix his abode.

'lire oracle directed him to follow a heifer, which was described to
him, and wherever she should lie down, there to build a city, and to
call the country Boeotia. Cadmus soon found the heifer‚and put
himself under her guidunce3 she at length lay down near the banhs
of the river Cephisus, where he prepared to commence the city
according to the directions of the oracle. Here the present account
begins. The spot is a little north of Attica. Cadmus is supposed to
have come into Grecce A.c.1493,and to have brou ht with him
the use of letters, and the worship of many of the lgyptiau and
Piioeniciau divinities. ·
